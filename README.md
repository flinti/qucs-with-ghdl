# Wrapper script for Qucs digital simulation with ghdl
As freehdl is no longer maintained and segfaults on linux, the digital Qucs simulation does not work on linux. This modification of the qucsdigi wrapper script runs the simulation of digital Qucs circuits with ghdl.


Put the script into /usr/local/bin/ or replace /usr/bin/qucsdigi
